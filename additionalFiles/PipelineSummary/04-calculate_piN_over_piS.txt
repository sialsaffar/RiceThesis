## Pipeline for running SNPGenie scripts:

1. The script `snpgenie_within_group.pl` takes 2 files as an input: a MSA file in fasta format and a coding region (CDS) annotations in GTF format. Note: This script needs to be run twice; once for the annotations on the forward "+" strand, and the other for the reverse "-" strand.

    ./snpgenie_within_group.pl --fasta_file_name=MSA.fasta --gtf_file_name=CDS.gtf --procs_per_node=<INT>
    
2. Run `fasta2revcom.pl` script on the MSA file to generate reverse complement sequence:

    ./fasta2recom.pl MSA.fasta
    
3. Run `gtf2revcom.pl` script to generate CDS annotations for the reverse "-" strand. Two argument required: A GTF file with CDS annotations and the length of the sequence (e.g. chr01 = 43270923).

    ./gtf2revcom.pl CDS.gtf 43270923
    
4. Now run `snpgenie_within_group.pl` again but with the revcom files.

    ./snpgenie_within_group.pl --fasta_file_name=MSA_revcom.fasta --gtf_file_name=CDS_revcom.gtf procs_per_node=<INT>
    
    Note: Output files have the same name, and files from a previous run will be overwritten. So renaming/moving output files immediately after each run is advised.
